      <h3>Trekking to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triund">Triund</a></h3>

      <p>Mostly every weekend me and my colleague go for trekking during summer. And these are somes images.Its  two hour trekking.
         We set up a tent and spent one night and came back the later evening.</p>

         <p>Grade: Moderate Mcleodganj to Triund 2800 mtrs, 9 kms gradual trek. The trek offer panoramic views Bhagsu village, Mcleodganj, Dharamsala valley and distant views of Shivalik hills and plains of Kangra valley. The trek is moderate nature. Triund is a large land of green grass and pasture like. One can see the mighty Dhauladhar ranges just above the eyes. This is the base camp and climatization 
          point for trekkers climbing the Inderahara point in the Mt. Dhauladhar.</p>
