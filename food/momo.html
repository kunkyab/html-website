<p><b><i>Momos</i></b> are a type of steamed filled dumpling in Tibetan[1] and Nepali cuisine[2] that is also popular in neighbouring Bhutan and India.[3] Momos are usually served with a sauce known as achar influenced by the spices and herbs used within many South Asian cuisines. It can also be cooked as soup versions known as jhol momo where the broth is made from achar using a mixture of tomatoes, sesame seeds, chillies, cumin and coriander or mokthuk
   from boiling pork/buffalo bones mixed with various herbs and vegetables.[4]</p>
  
  <h3><strong>Origin</strong></h3>
  
  <p>"Momo", as written, is a phonetic transcription of the Tibetan word མོག་མོག (Wylie: mog mog, Tibetan pronunciation: [moʔ˩˨.ˈmoʔ]). It is possible that this Tibetan word is borrowed from the Chinese term momo (馍馍), a name traditionally used in northwestern Chinese
    dialects for wheat steamed buns and bread. The word mo (馍) itself means wheat flour food products or mantou (馒头), steamed buns.[5] Historically, Chinese names for steamed buns did not distinguish between those with or without fillings until the term baozi (包子) 
    emerged during the Song Dynasty between the tenth and thirteenth century.[6] However, in eastern regions of China such as Jiangsu and Shanghai, mantou continues to carry both meanings in modern day.[7] In the Nepal Bhasa language, the word mome (मम) means cooking by steaming. 
    The history of momos in Nepal dates back to as early as the fourteenth century.[8]</p>
