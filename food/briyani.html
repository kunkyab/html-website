<p><b><i> Chicken Biryani </i></b> is a mixed rice dish, mainly popular in South Asia. It is made with rice, some type of meat (chicken, goat, pork, lamb, beef, prawn, or fish) and spices. To cater to vegetarians, in some cases, it is prepared by substituting vegetables or paneer for the meat.[1]
   Sometimes eggs and/or potatoes are also added.[2]</p>
  <p>Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia and among the South Asian diaspora, although the dish is often associated with the region's Muslim population in particular.[3] Similar dishes are also prepared in other parts of the world such as in Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia.[4] Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services, 
    and has been labelled as the most popular dish overall in India.</p>
