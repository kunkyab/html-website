  <p><p><strong><i>Eleven Minutes</i></strong>  is the story of Maria, a young girl from a Brazilian village,
     whose first innocent brushes with love leave her heartbroken. At a tender age, she becomes convinced that she will 
     never find true love, instead believing that "love is a terrible thing that will make you suffer. . . ." A chance 
     meeting in Rio takes her to Geneva, where she dreams of finding fame and fortune. Maria's despairing view of love 
     is put to the test when she meets a handsome young painter. In this odyssey of self-discovery, Maria has to choose 
     between pursuing a path of darkness - sexual pleasure for its own sake - or risking everything to find her own "inner 
     light" and the possibility of sacred sex, sex in the context of love.
