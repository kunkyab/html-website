     <p>Fall in love with the addictive, suspenseful love story between a teenage girl and a vampire with the book that sparked a "literary phenomenon" and redefined
     romance for a generation (New York Times).</p>
 
     <p>Isabella Swan's move to Forks, a small, perpetually rainy town in Washington, could have been the most boring move she ever made. But once she meets the mysterious and alluring Edward Cullen,
     Isabella's life takes a thrilling and terrifying turn.</p>
     <p>Up until now, Edward has managed to keep his vampire identity a secret in the small community he lives in, but now nobody is safe, especially Isabella, the person Edward holds most dear. The lovers find themselves balanced 
      precariously on the point of a knife -- between desire and danger.</p>
